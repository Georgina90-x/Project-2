##  Wireframes

I have provided a screenshot of an initial design idea for the layout of Name That Flag.

## UX

- The wireframe design of Name That Flag demonstrates its suitability for both mobile and desktop design.
- Name That Flag has a block colour background that does not distract or visually impair users from being able to see the flags as they are intended.
- It is clear to the user that Name That Flag is a game and that they are given options to select the answer that identifies the flag.

### Colour Scheme

- As Name That Flag is a game that involves flags with a number of colours, it was important for the background to be unobtrusive and allowed to show the flags correctly to avoid any doubt or confusion for the user.
- The colours used are as follows:-

- `#171212` licorice used for primary text.
- `#8D99AE` cool grey used for primary highlights such as borders.
- `#fafafa` used for secondary text.
- `#FFFFFF` white used for a clean and crisp background to not obscure the colours of the flags.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/171212-8d99ae-ffffff-473198-090c9b) to generate my colour palette, I locked in licorice and white as I knew I wanted these as the main colours to the site and then ran through the simulations to generate alternative colours that may complement as contrast but I knew that a majority of the site would be white with black text.

### Typography

- I used the Google Font called 'Nunito' for the Name That Flag site.
- As a key part of the game was for users to read the options available to them, it was imperitive that a clean legible font was used suitable for all users to clearly read the text on the website especially when using a mobile device.

- [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) was used for all text within the site.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used to provide inconography to the website where appropriate.

## User Stories
